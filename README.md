## Hi there 👋, my name is Rakul Maria Hjalmarsdóttir Tórgarð

## 👩🏻‍🦰 About me

My name is Rakul [ˈraːkʊl] and I'm a Computer Science student, interested in applied analytical data science and the visualisation of it. I specifically enjoy analysing data using python libraries to leverage the analysis part, and then using cool visualisation tools like [D3](https://d3js.org) or [bokeh](http://bokeh.org) to visualize my findings 📊.

When I'm not spending my time behind a computer, you can find me 🏃🏻‍♀️ running in the park, 🧶 knitting at a café or 🍵🍄‍🟫 brewing Kombucha in my kitchen.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on ...

- School projects about data analysis and visualization 📚

## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
